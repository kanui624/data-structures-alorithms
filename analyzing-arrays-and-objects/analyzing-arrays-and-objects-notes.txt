Analyzing Arrays and Objects Notes:

We use Objects when: 
    - We don't need to worry about order
    - We need fast access / insertion / removal / searching
        - The time complexity of these operations on and object with key/value pairs:
                - Access: O(1) Constant Time
                - Insertion: O(1) Constant Time
                - Removal: O(1) Constant Time
                - Searching: O(n) Linear Time
        - The time complexity of these Object Methods are:
                - Object.keys: O(n) Linear Time
                - Object.values: O(n) Linear Time
                - Object.entries: O(n) Linear Time
                - hasOwnProperty: O(1) Constant Time
