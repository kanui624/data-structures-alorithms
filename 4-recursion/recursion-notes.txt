Recursion Notes

What is recursion?
A process (a function in our case) that calls itself

Why Should we know this?
    - It's everywhere
    - Even JSON.parse or JSON.stringify are recursive functions
    - dom.getElementById and DOM traversal algorithms (the dom
    is a tree structure where nested elements are like nodes in
    a tree)
    - Object traversal
    - We'll see it with more complex data structures
    
How recursive functions work
    - Invoke the same function with a different input until you 
    reach a base case
    - The base case is the condition when the recursion ends

The two essential parts of a recursive function
    - the base case
    - different input every iteration
