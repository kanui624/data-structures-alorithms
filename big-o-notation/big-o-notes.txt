Big O Notation Notes:

- It's important to have a precise vocabulary to talk about how our code performs
- Useful for discussing time and space trade-offs between different solutions
- Big-O helps with debugging and identifying points in the code that are slowly the execution down or making it crash
- Definitely needed for coding interviews

- Things to think about when comming up with a solution and writing code for it:
    - Do I have any time and space limitations that I should be considering?
    - How fast does it Run?
    - How much memory does it use? 
    - Is my code readable?
