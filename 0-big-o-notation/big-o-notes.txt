Big O Notation Notes:

- It's important to have a precise vocabulary to talk about how our code performs
- Useful for discussing time and space trade-offs between different solutions
- Big-O helps with debugging and identifying points in the code that are slowing
  the execution down or making it crash
- Definitely needed for coding interviews

- Things to think about when comming up with a solution and writing code for it:
    - Do I have any time and space limitations that I should be considering?
    - How fast does it Run?
    - How much memory does it use? 
    - Is my code readable? 

- The Problem with time: 
    - Time will record differently on different machines
    - Even the same machine will record different run times on the same solution
    - For specifically fast running solutions, speed measurments may not be 
      precise enough
    
- The base idea of Big-O Notation:
    - Instead of counting actual runtime seconds which are so variable, we should 
      count and label specific operations computer has to perform, a label that 
      remains constant independent of the machine we are running it from
    - It allows us to talk formally about how the runtime of an algorithm grows as 
      the inputs grow

- Big O Definition 
    - f(n) could be linear: (f(n) = n)
        - As n scales up, the run time scales up proportionally 
    - f(n) could be quadratic: (f(n) = n^2)
        - The runtime is related to the square of n 
    - f(n) could be constant: (f(n) = 1)
        - As n grows the runtimes stays the same
    - f(n) could be exponential: (f(n) = 1^n)
    - f(n) could be something different

Simplifying Big O Expressions
    - Constants don't matter:
        O(2n) => O(n)
        O(500) => O(1)
        O(13n^2) => O(n^2)
    - Smaller Terms don't matter
        O(n + 10) => O(n)
        O(1000n + 50) => O(n)
        O(n^2 + 5n + 8) => O(n^2) 

Rules of Thumb for Time complexity
    - Arithmetic operations are constant
    - Variable assignment is constant
    - Accessing elements in an array (by index) or object (by key) is constant
    - In a loop, the complexity is the length of the loop times the complexity
      of whatever happens inside the loop

Space Complexity
    - How much additional memory do we need to allocate in order to run the code 
      in our algorithm?
    - When talking about space complexity we're talking about Auxillary space 
      complexity, unless otherwise noted

* Auxillary Space: the space required by the algorithm, not including space taken
  up by the inputs.

Rules of Thumb for Space complexity:
    - Most primitives (booleans, numbers, undefined, null) are constant space
    - Strings require O(n) space (where n is the string length)
    - Reference types (arrays, objects) are generally O(n), where n is the length 
      (for arrays) or the number of keys (for objects)
    
Logarithms
    - Log is the inverse of exponentiation
        - log(2)8 = 3 => (2^3 = 8)
        - log(base2)Value = exponent => 2^exponent = Value
    - We can omit the base 2 when writing log notation becasue it is assumed in 
      computer programming
    - Logarithmic Time complexity is great! O(log n) Is the next best to constant time

Rule of Thumb
    - The logarithm of a number roughly measures the number of times you can divde 
      that number by 2 before you get a value that id less than or equal to 1
    - Below since we divided three times below log8 = 3
    (8 / 2) = (4 / 2) = (2 / 2) = 1

Algorithms to watch for logarithmic time complexity
    - Certain searching Algorithms, some of which are very efficient
    - Recursion sometimes involves logarithmic space complexity

Recap Notes
    - To analyze the performance of an algorithm we can use big O notation 
    - Big O notation can give us a high level understanding of the time or space
      implications of an algorithm
    - Big O notation doesn't care about prcision, only about the general (linear?
      quadratic? constant?)
    - Time and space complexity (as measured by big O), depends only on the 
      algorithm, not the hardware used to run the algorithm
