Searching Algorithms

- Linear Search 
    - Best O(N): Time
    - Worst O(1): Time
    - Average O(N): Time

- Binary Search
    - much faster form of Search
    - rather than eliminating one element at a time, 
    you can eliminate half of the remaining elements at a time 
    - binary search only works on sorted arrays
    - divide and conquer

- Binary search Big O
    - Worst O(log n): Time
    - Best  O(1): Time
