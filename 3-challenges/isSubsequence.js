// Multiple Pointers - isSubsequence
// Prompt:
// Write a function called isSubsequence which takes in two strings and checks whether the
// characters in the first string form a subsequence of the second string. In other words, the
// function should check whether the characters in the first string appear somewhere in the
// second string, without their order changing.

// Restate:
// Write a function that takes in two strings and check to see if the first string is a
// subsequence of the second string. return a boolean specifying if so or not

// Input:
// two strings

// Outputs:
// Boolean

// Edge Cases:
// Can one character be considered and subSequence?
// Is it only a subsequence if it's characters are in the same order as the comparing string?

// Test I/O:
// isSubsequence("hello", "hello world") => true
// isSubsequence("sing", "string") => true
// isSubsequence("abc", "y a slkdj b sdklj c ") => true
// isSubsequence("acb", "abc") => false

//
