Analyzing Arrays and Objects Notes:

We use Objects when: 
    - We don't need to worry about order
    - We need fast access / insertion / removal / searching
        - The time complexity of these operations on and object with key/value pairs:
                - Access: O(1) Constant Time
                - Insertion: O(1) Constant Time
                - Removal: O(1) Constant Time
                - Searching: O(n) Linear Time
        - The time complexity of these Object Methods are:
                - Object.keys: O(n) Linear Time
                - Object.values: O(n) Linear Time
                - Object.entries: O(n) Linear Time
                - hasOwnProperty: O(1) Constant Time
We use Arrays when:
    - We need order
    - We need fast access / insertion / removal (sort of...)
        - Time complexity of these operations in an array:
                - Insertion: It depends...
                - Removal: It depends...
                - Searching: - O(n)
                - Access: O(1)

* Push and Pop are always faster then Shift and Unshift. Respectively they run in 
constant time vs linear time because the former simply appened or remove an index 
not affecting the order of any other elements while the latter affect the index 
assignment of all subsequent elements

Array Methods and thier time complexities:
    - Push:     O(1) - Appends new elements to an array, and returns the new length of the array.
    - Pop:      O(1)
    - Shift:    O(N) - Removes the first element from an array and returns it.
    - Unshift:  O(N) - Inserts new elements at the start of an array.
    - Concat:   O(N)
    - Slice:    O(N)
    - Splice:   O(N)
    - Sort:     O(N*LogN)
    - forEach/Map/Filter/Reduce: O(N)
