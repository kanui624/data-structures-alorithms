Objectives
    - Define what an algorithm is
    - Devise a plan to solve algorithms
    - Compare and contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters,
      two pointer problems and divide and conquer
    
What is an Algorithm?
    - A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task

Why do we need to know this as programmers?
    - Almost everything that we do in programming involves some kind of algorithm
    - It's the foundation for being a successful problem solver and developer

How to improve? 
    - Devise a plan for solving problems
    - Master common problem solving patterns

Problem Solving Strategies
    - Understand the problem 
    - Explore concrete examples 
    - Break it down 
    - Solve/Simplify
    - Look Back and Refactor

Understand the Problem 
    - Questions to ask interviewer or yourself:
        - Can you restate the problem in your own words?
        - What are the inputs that go into the problem?
        - What outputs should come from the solution to the problem?
        - Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have
        enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this
        question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay, it's still 
        worth considering the question at this early stage)
        - How should I label the important 

Exploring Concrete examples
    - Coming up with examples can help you understand the problem better
    - Examples also provide sanity checks that your eventual solution works how it
    should
    
Explore Examples   
    - Start with simple Examples        
    - Progress to more complex examples
    - Explore examples with empty inputs
    - Explore examples with invalid inputs
    
Break it down
    - Write psuedo code or simple step by step comments
            - This helps you to think about your code you'll write before you write 
            it, and helps you catch any lingering conceptual issues or 
            misunderstandings before you dive in and have to worry about details
Solve and Simplify
    - Solve the problem if you can and if not then solve a simpler problem
    - Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do 
    - Temporarily ignore that difficulty
    - Write a simplified solution 
    - Then incorporate that difficulty
Look back and Refactor
    - Can you check the result?
    - Can you derive the result differently?
    - Can you understand it at a glance?
    - Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
    - Can you improve the performance of your solution?
    - Can you think of other ways to Refactor?
    - How have other people solved this problem?

How to improve at problem solving:
    - Devise a plan for solving problems
    - Master common problem solving patterns

Some of the patterns for solving problems:
    - Frequency counter
    - Multiple Pointers
    - Sliding Window
    - Divide and conquer
    - Dynamic programming
    - Greedy algorithms
    - Backtracking
